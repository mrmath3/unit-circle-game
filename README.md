# 🧮 Unit Circle Click Game

This interactive game helps students master the locations of angles on the unit circle using radians. Players are shown a radian value (e.g., \( \frac{\pi}{6} \)) and must click the corresponding point on a custom SVG unit circle. Great for high school math classrooms!

## 🔥 Features

- Clean, responsive SVG-based unit circle
- MathJax-rendered angle prompts
- Instant feedback for correct or incorrect answers
- Optional alternate angles like \( 13\pi/6 \) and \( -\pi/6 \)
- 30-second challenge mode with countdown timer
- Local high score leaderboard with percentage accuracy
- Sound effects for correct and incorrect answers
- Fully offline and self-contained (no server required)

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click the correct angle when prompted.
2. A 30-second timer starts on your first click.
3. Try to answer as many correctly as you can before time runs out.
4. Enter your name to save your score to the local leaderboard.
5. Use the checkbox to enable alternate angles for an added challenge.
